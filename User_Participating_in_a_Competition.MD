# Participation in Benchmark Procedures

## Enrollment and Configuration
Engaging in a benchmark initiative entails a structured process that commences with [user registration](https://ai4media-bench.aimultimedialab.ro/accounts/signup) and account configuration. During the registration phase, essential personal information, namely your username and a valid email address, must be provided, while acknowledging and accepting the provided Terms and Conditions. In the event of forgetting your password, a password recovery system is in place to facilitate retrieval.

Moreover, an option to modify your password can be accessed by clicking on your name located in the upper right-hand corner of the interface. Additionally, within the same menu, you can also tailor your profile, adjust account settings, refine notification preferences, and establish organizations, each of which comes with corresponding administrative settings.

## Registration for a Benchmark Challenge
When embarking on your journey to contribute to a benchmark challenge, you will be prompted to acknowledge and comply with the benchmark rules, as well as complete your registration for the specific challenge. 
Upon submission of your registration request, the benchmark organizers will be notified, and they will assess and approve your registration. Certain competitions offer the option to collaborate as an organization and may display your organization's designation on the leaderboard when submitting entries. In specific instances, participation as a organization may necessitate a formal organization registration process. It is imperative to closely adhere to the instructions provided by the competition organizing committee to ensure compliance with the competition's guidelines and requirements

## Competition Detail Tab Navigation
Used to transition between distinct areas of interest and information within the competition framework.

### Get Started
Contains all the competition pages, and files.

### Phases
Contains a diagram list with details on each phase in the order in which they're active.

### My Submissions
This view contains a table with all your submissions, and allows you to upload new ones.

#### Submission of Entries
The process of submitting your contributions to a benchmark involves the uploading of a compressed file bundle (in the .zip format) that contains your response materials, adhering to the format stipulated by the benchmark organizers. 
The benchmark allows for two discrete submission categories: code or results. Code submissions encompass a metadata file specifying the execution command, whereas result submissions provide the solution to the problem, without executing any code on the platform.

To initiate a submission, follow these steps:
1. Sign in to [AI4MediaBench](https://ai4media-bench.aimultimedialab.ro/). If you do not have an existing account, you will need to create one.
2. Choose the specific benchmark challenge you wish to participate in.
3. Access the "My Submissions" tab, where you can upload your response materials.
4. Click on the paper clip icon and select your .zip file to commence the submission process.
