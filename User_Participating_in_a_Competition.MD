# Participation in Benchmark Procedures

## Enrollment and Configuration
Engaging in a benchmark initiative entails a structured process that commences with user registration and account configuration. During the registration phase, essential personal information, namely your full name and a valid email address, must be provided.

## Registration for a Benchmark Challenge
When embarking on your journey to contribute to a benchmark challenge, you will be prompted to acknowledge and comply with the benchmark rules, as well as complete your registration for the specific challenge. 
Upon submission of your registration request, the benchmark organizers will be notified, and they will assess and approve your registration. It is imperative to diligently follow any subsequent directives furnished by the organizing committee.

## Submission of Entries
The process of submitting your contributions to a benchmark involves the uploading of a compressed file bundle (in the .zip format) that contains your response materials, adhering to the format stipulated by the benchmark organizers. 
The benchmark allows for two discrete submission categories: code or results. Code submissions encompass a metadata file specifying the execution command, whereas result submissions provide the solution to the problem, without executing any code on the platform.

To initiate a submission, follow these steps:
1. Sign in to [AI4MediaBench](https://ai4media-bench.aimultimedialab.ro/). If you do not have an existing account, you will need to create one.
2. Choose the specific benchmark challenge you wish to participate in.
3. Access the "My Submissions" tab, where you can upload your response materials.
4. Click on the paper clip icon and select your .zip file to commence the submission process.

This interface also facilitates the creation of new submissions and allows you to review past submissions for each phase of the competition. Additionally, the Resources Interface provides an overview of all your submissions.

# Reviewing Benchmark Outcomes
To stay informed about the progress and results of benchmarks in which you are actively involved, navigate to the "Results" tab. This section displays the leaderboard, offering a comprehensive view of benchmark standings and outcomes. 
It should be noted that certain benchmarks may exclusively unveil their results upon the conclusion of the benchmarking campaign.
