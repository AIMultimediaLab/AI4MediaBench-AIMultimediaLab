This page serves a straightforward purpose - the submission of a fully assembled competition bundle to AI4MediaBench, initiating the process of converting it into a functional competition instance. For comprehensive insights into the structure of competition bundles, please refer to the following [link](https://github.com/AIMultimediaLab/AI4MediaBench-AIMultimediaLab/blob/main/Competition-Bundle-Structure.MD).

To commence this process, kindly initiate the submission by selecting the paperclip icon or the adjacent bar, which will prompt a file selection dialogue. Within this dialogue, choose your competition bundle and proceed by clicking the "upload" option. Subsequently, upon successful completion of AI4MediaBench's processing and unpacking procedures, you shall receive a confirmation message along with a link to access your newly established competition.
